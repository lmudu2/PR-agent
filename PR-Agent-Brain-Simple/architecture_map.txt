# System Architecture Map: Payment & Scanner Ecosystem

## Services:
1. **User-Profile-Service**: Manages user metadata and unique identifiers. 
   - Database: PostgreSQL (Table: `users`)
   - Primary Key: `user_id` (Currently defined as INTEGER)

2. **Legacy-Scanner-Adapter**: A 10-year-old service that scans physical QR codes. 
   - Dependency: Directly queries the `users` table in the User-Profile-Service.
   - Constraint: This service is "Hard-Coded" to only accept Numeric User IDs.

3. **Notification-Engine**: Sends SMS/Email alerts to users.
   - Connection: Listens to the User-Profile-Service via an SNS Topic.

## Known Risks:
- The Legacy-Scanner-Adapter is brittle. Any change to the `users` table schema usually breaks the scanner sync.
